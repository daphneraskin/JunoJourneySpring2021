Just navigating to a page is not very useful. What we'd really like to do is to interact with the pages, or more specifically the HTML elements within a page. To do this, WebDriver offers 8 ways to find elements. 

There are various strategies to locate elements in a page. You can use the most appropriate one for your case (using the HTML of the chosen element): 
Here's some example HTML page source: 

<html>
 <body>
  <form id="loginForm">
   <input name="username" type="text" />
   <input name="password" type="password" />
   <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
   <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
  </form>
</body>
<html>

To demonstrate how to use the 8 locator techniques, let's use the above as an example.

1) find_element_by_id 
    Example: if page source says that <form id = "loginForm">, you can locate using
    login_form = driver.find_element_by_id('loginForm')
    
2) find_element_by_name
    Example: if page source says that <input name = "username" type="text" />, you can locate using 
    username = driver.find_element_by_name('username')
    password = driver.find_element_by_name('password')
    
3) find_element_by_xpath
    XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. Because HTML can be an implementation of XML, Selenium can leverage this to target elements in web applications.
    One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don't have a suitable id or name attribute for the element you wish to locate
    You can use XPath to:
      a) locate the element in absolute terms (not advised) or 
      b) relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute
    - Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as a result aare likely to fail with only the slightest change on the web app
    - Locating the element based on nearby elements w an id/name is ideal, because it is much less likely to change and can make your test more robust
    
    The login form in the example can be located using different xpaths as such: 
      A) Absolute path (would break if HTML was changed even slightly)
         login_form = driver.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/form[1]")
      B) First form element in the HTML
         login_form = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//form[1]")
      C) The form element with attribute 'id' set to 'loginForm'
         login_form = driver.find_element_by_xpath(login_form = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//form[@id='loginForm']")
    
    
4) find_element_by_link_text

5) find_element_by_partial_link_text

6) find_element_by_tag_name

7) find_element_by_class_name

8) find_element_by_css_selector

For example, given an element as defined by 
   <input type = "text" name = "passwd" id= "passwd-id" />, you can find it using any of: 
element = driver.find_element_by_id("passwd-id")
element = driver.find_element_by_name("passwd")
element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//input[@id='passwd-id']")
element = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("input#passwd-id")

To find multiple elements (these methods will return a list):
find_elements_by_name
find_elements_by_xpath
find_elements_by_link_text
find_elements_by_partial_link_text
find_elements_by_tag_name
find_elements_by_class_name
find_elements_by_css_selector

There are an additional 2 private methods (as opposed to the public methods above), which can be used for locating page elements:
find_element()
find_elements()

Example usage of the private methods:
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//button[text()="Some text"]')
driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//button')
